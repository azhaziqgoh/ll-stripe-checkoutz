## Learning Loops - Stripe Checkout

This is a Next.js based stripe checkout. The challenge was to create Stripe Checkout as minimal code as possible.

The approach taken to deliver this solution was to used prebuilt stripe checkout

## Why PreBuilt?
It's the least complex way to implement stripe checkout with couple of lines

## Solution Assumption
- Store have unlimited stock
- User can only all the item listed once for each sessions

## Future Improvement
- Implement webhook
- Introduce inventory stock system

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [MUI](https://mui.com/components/grid/)

## Typical Next.js CLI Readme

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
